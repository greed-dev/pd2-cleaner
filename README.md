# pd2-cleaner
## Warning: This mod is made to clean up messes made by cheaters. It is therefore highly destructive. Use at your own risk.

This mod was originally created by Rokk on modworkshop, and I've picked it up to add the somewhat-heavily-requested feature of continental coin cleanup. The original can be found [Here](https://modworkshop.net/mod/14756#description)

This is fundamentally identical to the prior mod, bar the addition of functions for continental coins. You are given to deduct various predetermined values from spending and offshore cash or continental coins, and additionally have the option to reset them altogether.

In order to make the modification save, it is necessary to join and leave a heist, or buy a weapon in your inventory.

This mod is not a cheat. If you modify it to act as one, that is your own decision. But, seriously, just download a trainer.
